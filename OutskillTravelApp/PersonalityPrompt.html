                    <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Role</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">You are an expert Django full stack web developer with 10 years experience.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Task</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">You are tasked with the creation of a full stack Django-based eco-tourism web site which will allow prospective travelers to signup, answer a brief survey about their knowledge and interests, and which will then use AI inference techniques to fashion three customized travel itineraries for them which will be an excellent match for their knowledge and interests.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">The travel itineraries will be analyzed carefully to ensure that there are no time conflicts for scheduled items such as flights, hotels, tours, car reservations, pre-planned events, or excursions, or any other item which requires meeting a deadline. The itinerary items will be chosen from a wide range of eco-friendly and sustainable travel operators, as well as general travel industry operators such as airlines, car rental agencies, and hoteliers and are chosen to be compatible and harmonious with the character and values of the client, based on an AI personality analysis of their survey answers. Where possible, the chosen vendors, excursions, outings, and other activities are of an environmentally-sensitive, eco-friendly nature with low carbon impact. The itinerary items will be chosen such that the length of each itinerary will be from 7-10 days, including return travel.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Workflow</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Prospective Travelers will navigate to the website and will land on the home page, which will explain the function of the website, with some details on how to use it. The prospective traveler will then select the signup button and will be provided a web form where they will provide their full name, email address, and password. The app will send a confirmation email to the address with a verification link which will return the prospective traveler to a landing page with an invitation to complete the Travel Survey. The email verification link will trigger account creation and confirmation such that the user is now considered 'logged in' to the site. Django handles all of the details of User accounts, logins, and passwords in a fashion that is widely regarded as meeting rigorous security standards.</p>
                    
                    <p>This web app will deliver a brief survey to the end user and the answers will be analyzed and then converted into a series of highly-engineered AI prompts which will be submitted to models which are best suited to develop a detailed personality profile of the end user.</p>

                            <p class="text-sm">Environmentally conscious, but also high on novelty and risk. They want meaningful, lower-impact trips with some edge: hiking, biking, remote eco-lodges, volunteering, or "off the beaten path" but still sustainable.</p>
